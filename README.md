# climate-migration-project

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict **climate-induced migration outflows** in Somalia. It integrates data from **GDELT (news coverage), IOM/DTM (displacement tracking), weather sources, and development indicators** to build a region-month level dataset. The aim is to identify regional "hotspots"â€”areas likely to generate out-migration in response to environmental and human security stressors.

---

## Objective

The goal is to predict **migration outflows** from regions in Somalia, by:
- Aggregating multi-source data (climate, news (from GDELT), displacement, vulnerability)
- Creating a region-month panel dataset
- Constructing vulnerability indices
- Comparing the predictive value of news vs. real-world weather
- Evaluating ML model performance and generalizability

---

## Target Variable

- `migration_outflows`: Number of people leaving a region per month (main prediction target)

## Notes

- **Migration outflows** are prioritized to identify climate hotspots.
- **Regional Vulnerability Index** is built from **multiple separate CSVs**, including:
  - Demographics (IOM, World Bank)
  - Infrastructure
  - Political governance (V-Dem)
  - Socioeconomic indicators
- Each of these is cleaned and merged during feature engineering.
